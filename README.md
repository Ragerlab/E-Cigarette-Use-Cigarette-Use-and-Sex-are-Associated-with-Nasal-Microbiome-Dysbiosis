# E-Cigarette Use, Cigarette Smoking, and Sex are Associated with Nasal Microbiome Dysbiosis

This repository contains script associated with the unpublished manuscript "E-Cigarette Use, Cigarette Smoking, and Sex are Associated with Nasal Microbiome Dysbiosis" (Hickman E, Roca C, Zorn BT, Rebuli ME, Robinette C, Wolfgang MC, Jaspers I, 2023), currently under review with Nicotine & Tobacco Research.

Script authors: Elise Hickman, PhD (ehickman@email.unc.edu) and Cristian Roca Avendano, MS (cristianroca@unc.edu)

The script was developed to:

1. Process microbiome data.
2. Determine differences in microbiome composition between non-smokers, smokers, and e-cig users and between male and female participants.
3. Determine whether mediators of host-microbiome interaction were present at significantly different concentrations in nasal lavage fluid of non-smokers, smokers, and e-cig users.

Each part of the script is organized into a separate sub-directory containing its respective .Rmd, input files, and output files/figures.
